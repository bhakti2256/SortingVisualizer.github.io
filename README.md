# SortingVisualizer

I have created a sorting visualiser for expanding my knowledge in JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Also I learnt about various sorting algorithms.

The sorting algorithms given are: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort and Merge sort.
Also for better user experience, I have created sliders for changing array size and speed of execution.

For understanding: less speed + less array size.
For visual experience: more speed + more array size.
